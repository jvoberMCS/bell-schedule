### Chrome

To change Chrome's autoplay policy, navigate to "chrome://flags/#autoplay-policy" in your browser's address bar, then select the desired autoplay setting from the "Autoplay policy" option; usually, you'll want to choose "No user gesture is required" to completely disable the autoplay restriction and allow videos to play automatically.
